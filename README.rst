django-pymssql
==============

Goals
-----

django-pymssql is a Django database backend for Microsoft SQL Server that
works on non-Windows systems.

It's a small wrapper around django-mssql_ that uses pymssql_ instead of ADO to
connect to SQL Server.

It should support the same versions of Python, Django and SQL Server as
django-mssql_.

The original use case was to connect to SQL Server from a Django projet
written in Python 3 and running on Linux.

Status
------

As of June 5th, 2014, django-pymssql almost_ passes Django's test suite with:

- Python 2.7
- The stable/1.7.x branch of Django
- The development version of pymssql
- The development version of django-mssql

Alternatives
------------

django-sqlserver_ is a fork of django-mssql_ that supports python-tds_ and
pymssql_ in addition to ADO on Windows. Unfortunately it has diverged and it
lags behind django-mssql_ when it comes to supporting newer Django versions.

django-pyodbc_ relies on pyodbc_ to connect to SQL Server. It requires a
complex stack which doesn't bring actual benefits. Besides it doesn't appear
to be very mature nor actively maintained.

Some database version checking code was borrowed from django-sqlserver_.
